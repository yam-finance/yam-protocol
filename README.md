## The Protocol
The whale fights the shrimp, and it has never changed since ancient times. Who said shrimp can't fight big whales? As long as we are united!

Shrimp is a community that gathers all investors. We share the latest Pump tokens and collectively discuss the latest DeFi technology! Anyone who holds 3000 $Shrimp Coins or equivalent to 4000 $USD can make a Advanced Pool. All Shrimp Holders will start marketing your token! why? Because we are a group of people who want to fight whales.

## Governance([More info](https://github.com/shrimp-finance/shrimp-protocol/wiki/Shrimp-Governance))
Governance is entirely dictated by Shrimp holders from the start. Upon deployment, ownership of all Shrimp protocol contracts will be reliquished to the timelocked Governance contract or removed entirely. At the very least, this can be seen as a reference implementation for a truly decentralized protocol.

Anybody with 5% of Shrimp to their address can propose a governance action; these are simple or complex sets of actions, such as adding support for a new shrimping pool, changing an Advanced Pool fee.

## Audits

None. Contributors have given their best efforts to ensure the security of these contracts, but make no guarantees. It has been spot checked by just a few pairs of eyes. It is a probability - not just a possibility - that there are bugs. That said, minimal changes were made to the staking/distribution contracts that have seen hundreds of millions flow through them via SNX, YFI, and YFI derivatives. The reserve contract is excessively simple as well. We prioritized staked assets' security first and foremost.

The original devs encourage governance to fund a bug bounty/security audit

The token itself is largely based on COMP which have undergone audits - but we made non-trivial changes.


If you feel uncomfortable with these disclousures, don't stake or hold Shrimp. If the community votes to fund an audit, or the community is gifted an audit, there is no assumption that the original devs will be around to implement fixes, and is entirely at their discretion.


## Distribution
Rather than allocating a portion of the supply to the founding team, Shrimp is being distributed in the spirit of YFI: no premine, no founder shares, no VC interests — simply equal-opportunity staking distribution to attract a broad and vision-aligned community to steward the future of the protocol and token.

The initial distribution of Shrump will be evenly distributed across 6 staking pools: WETH, DICE, CREAM, COMP, YFI, and ETH/SHRIMP Uniswap v2 LP tokens. These pools were chosen intentionally to reach a broad swath of the overall DeFi community, as well as specific communities with a proven commitment to active governance and an understanding of complex tokenomics.
